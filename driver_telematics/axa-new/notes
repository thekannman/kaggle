Found issue with maxbreak:
	since a is calculated from distance in v-space, no negative values allowed. Not truly measuring breaking.

Possible issue with fft:
	Since using distances, it is fft of solely positive value... is this really what I want?

Submitted ... without fixing above issues.

May consider using entirety of fft (up to some cutoff) instead of just select points. Current method uses different lengths for fft depending on length of input, so indices don't correspond to same frequency in all, should use select length instead.
May also consider using normalized fft in addition to standard fft to get freq info independent of max value

Should try to read data in faster using other downloaded program

Seed was set up using 0 not random for runs through replacing fft with tcf

pyRegression_22_27_February_12_2015.csv is regression
pyRegression_23_24_February_12_2015.csv is randomforest
.... is lasso

While using lasso:
